# **📜PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**
```html
DHL is an international Umbrella brand and trademark for the 
courier, package delivery, and express mail service 
which is a division of the German logistics firm Deutsche Post.
The company group delivers over 1.6 billion parcels per year.
The company DHL itself was founded in San Francisco, USA, in 1969 and expanded 
its service throughout the world by the late 1970s. 
In 1979, under the name of DHL Air Cargo,the company entered the Hawaiian Islands 
with an inter-island cargo service using two DC-3 and four DC-6 aircraft.
Adrian Dalsey and Larry Hillblom personally oversaw the daily operations
until its eventual bankruptcy closed the doors in 1983. 
At its peak, DHL Air Cargo employed just over 100 workers, management, and pilots.
